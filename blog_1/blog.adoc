[red big]*Utilize Ansible for opening and closing tickets with ServiceNow - Part 2.*


Opening and closing tickets is a very common step in network operations. This article is part two in a series covering the role Ansible can play in ticket automation.
This time we'll cover handling incidents in ServiceNow and adding output to your tickets right from your routers and switches.

You can see part one of this blog series here: https://www.thenetwork.engineer/blog/utilize-ansible-for-opening-and-closing-tickets-with-servicenow[Part 1]

This blog will expand farther into the capabilities of the https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/modules/snow_record_module.html[snow_record module].
In the playbook below, the [red]#table# parameter will determine what type of ticket will be opened ie.. change_request or incident etc...
I have specified that at the top of the playbook under [red]#vars#.
The show version task is using the http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/ios_command_module.html[ios_command module] to execute a command on a 3560 Cisco switch and storing the output as a variable named sn_comments.
This variable is then being used in the [red]#comments# parameter for our ServiceNow incident task.

[source,yaml]
----
---
- name: create ticket with notes
  hosts: ios
  gather_facts: no
  connection: network_cli

  vars:
    sn_table: incident
    short_description: "This ticket was created by Ansible"



  tasks:
  - name: include vars
    include_vars: incident_vars.yml

  - name: show version
    ios_command:
      commands:
        - show version
    register: sn_comments

  - name: create an incident
    snow_record:
      state: present
      table: "{{ sn_table }}"
      username: "{{ sn_username }}"
      password: "{{ sn_password }}"
      instance: "{{ sn_instance }}"
      data:
        priority: "{{ sn_priority}}"
        severity: "{{ sn_severity }}"
        category: "{{ sn_category }}"
        short_description: "{{ short_description }}"
        comments: "{{ sn_comments }}"
    register: new_incident

  - debug: var=new_incident.record.number
----


In an effort to use best practices, this time the ServiceNow incident task in our playbook will use variables for all of the parameters.
The variables can be included in our playbook or a separate vars file. I use both options in this scenario.
Because I'm storing passwords in incident_vars.yml, a good practice would be to encrypt this file using https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.4/vault.html[Ansible Vault].

[black big]*incident_vars.yml*

[source,yaml]
----
---
#snow record variables

username: admin
password: password
instance: dev99999

#data variables

sn_severity: 2
sn_priority: 2
sn_category: network

[black big]*Playbook run*

If you were to log into your instance of ServiceNow and view the incidents>all section.
You should see your incident (INC0010029) at the top. You should notice that the short description has been filled out by our playbook task.
[red]#(This is a test created by Ansible)#.

You can see in the comments section the output from our show version command, notice the IOS version, model, as well as uptime of the device.
You could run any command not just show version. I'm sure you can imagine what other data would be valuable to list inside your tickets.

There is a lot of text from the show version command. Keep in mind, you can filter this output and only record the specific data points you want.
This can be done with the https://github.com/ansible-network/network-engine[ansible-network.network-engine] role and custom parsers.

[black big]*If your interested in learning more about parsers and the ansible-network.network-engine role. Stay tuned, I will go deeper into filtering the output in Part 3 of this series.*
