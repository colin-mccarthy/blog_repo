[red big]*Installing Ansible Tower*


[black big]*Download the latest release*

----
curl -k -O https://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz
----


[black big]*Extract the Tarball*

----
gunzip ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz
----

----
tar xvf ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar
----

Ansible Tower gets installed with an Ansible playbook. You will need to configure the inventory file with the hostnames or IP addresses of the servers in the cluster.
In the example I will be using one server and defining it as localhost. In the case you want to have multiple nodes in the cluster you define them
under the [tower] section and if you want a separate Postgres database, you can define that hostname or IP under the [database] section.

----
cd ansible-tower-setup-3.5.0-1
----

----
vi inventory
----

----
[tower]
localhost ansible_connection=local

[database]

[all:vars]
admin_password='Redhat123!'

pg_host=''
pg_port=''

pg_database='awx'
pg_username='awx'
pg_password='Redhat123!'

rabbitmq_username=tower
rabbitmq_password='Redhat123!'
rabbitmq_cookie=cookiemonster

# Isolated Tower nodes automatically generate an RSA key for authentication;
# To disable this behavior, set this value to false
# isolated_key_generation=true
