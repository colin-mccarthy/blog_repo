[big red]*Ansible Tower Container groups*

What are they?
Serverless functions, Tower feature that runs a playbook on OpenShift/Kubernetes.

<Video Here>


This is made possible by using Ansible Runner.

The project can be found under the Ansible org on GitHub.

https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner

Below I will detail the steps required to set this up.


[big red]*OpenShift*

[black]*1. Create a Project/Namespace in OpenShift named (ansible-tower).*

[black]*2. Create a ServiceAccount named (tower).*

image:images/service.png[640,480]

[black]*3. Create a Role named (pod-manager).*

```
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: pod-manager
  namespace: ansible-tower
rules:
  - verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - create
      - update
      - patch
      - delete
    apiGroups:
      - ''
    resources:
      - pods
  - verbs:
      - create
    apiGroups:
      - ''
    resources:
      - pods/exec
```

[black]*4. Create a RoleBinding* that binds the pod manager role to the tower service account.

[big red]*Ansible Tower*

[big black]*1. Create the Credential*

image:images/cred.png[640,480]

[black]*CREDENTIAL TYPE*

Choose the  OpenShift or Kubernetes API Bearer Token type.

Copy the token from the service account created in that project
(User Management > Service Accounts > (tower) <-The one you made in the earlier steps)

[black]*OPENSHIFT OR KUBERNETES API ENDPOINT*

I grabbed the short version from the oc login command, it should look like (https://api.foo.openshift.io:6443)



[big black]*2. Create the Container Group*

In Ansible Tower under Instance Groups > The green plus symbol > CREATE CONTAINER GROUP

image:images/insgroup.png[640,480]

[big black]*3. Configure the Container Group*

Give it a name and select the OpenShift or Kubernetes API Bearer Token we created earlier in the steps above.

image:images/congroup.png[640,480]

Now the fun part, paste in your Kubernetes Pod manifest. I like to use this one as a default when first getting started.

[black]*Pod manifest*

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  namespace: ansible-tower
spec:
  containers:
    - image: 'registry.redhat.io/ansible-tower-37/ansible-runner-rhel7'
      tty: true
      stdin: true
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      args:
        - sleep
        - infinity
```

[black]*What about module dependencies?*

As we know in Ansible Tower we need to install out dependencies in custom virtual environments.
How can we accomplish this when using Container Groups?
Make your own container images with the dependencies already installed. Start by creating a base Ansible Runner image in Quay.
This way you control the software delivery supply chain. Mine is listed below.


https://quay.io/repository/colin_mccarthy/ansible-runner

I built this by cloning the Ansible Runner Github repo and then building from
https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner/blob/devel/Dockerfile.dev[Dockerfile.dev]







[black]*Runner with pysnow package installed*

https://quay.io/repository/colin_mccarthy/pysnow_pod


[black]*Dockerfile*
```
FROM quay.io/colin_mccarthy/ansible-runner:stable_1.4.x

# dependencies
RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir pysnow

# required
CMD ["ansible-runner", "run", "/runner"]
```

Once you have made your own image/s you can use them in your pod manifest like this.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  namespace: ansible-tower
spec:
  containers:
    - image: 'quay.io/colin_mccarthy/pysnow_pod:latest'
      tty: true
      stdin: true
      imagePullPolicy: Always
      args:
        - sleep
        - infinity
```









[big red]*Final thoughts*

This is a great way to get started with OpenShift if your coming from an Ansible background.
I suggest you look at Quay and build some images using the source from a Git repo option.
The GitOps and vulnerability scanning is really great.
