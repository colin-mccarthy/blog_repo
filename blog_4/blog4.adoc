[red big]*Utilize Ansible for opening and closing tickets with ServiceNow - Part 4.*

Here are links to  https://www.thenetwork.engineer/blog/utilize-ansible-for-opening-and-closing-tickets-with-servicenow[Part 1]
, https://www.thenetwork.engineer/blog/utilize-ansible-for-opening-and-closing-tickets-with-servicenow-part2[Part 2]
, and https://www.thenetwork.engineer/blog/utilize-ansible-for-opening-and-closing-tickets-with-servicenow-part3[Part 3]

This article is part four in a series covering the role Ansible can play in ticket automation.
This time we'll cover creating and managing a reusable and scalable role.


This blog post will cover my journey in creating and managing an open-source Ansible role for creating ServiceNow network tickets.
The role can be found https://galaxy.ansible.com/colin_mccarthy/servicenow_network_tickets[here] on Galaxy.

This role is not a completed out of the box solution for network ticketing. What it is meant to be is merely a starting point that accelerates your adoption of automating ServiceNow with Ansible.
If you follow all four blog posts this will be the one that starts to introduce more developer tools. Feel free to send me pull requests if you want to contribute to growing this role.

I will cover the tools and best practices I used while maintaining the https://github.com/colin-mccarthy/servicenow_network_tickets[GitHub] repo.

Including the https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow[GitFlow] process for making changes to the role and merging between dev and master branches.

But first... let me show you my idea of how this role would be used. Let's review one of the playbooks found in the examples folder https://github.com/colin-mccarthy/servicenow_network_tickets/tree/master/examples[here].
These four playbooks are designed for config compliance. They will add or remove any configs that don't match the intended state declared in the playbook.
In a production network the declared state my live somewhere else like in a host vars file or perhaps you could use a CMDB like ServiceNow or Netbox as your source of truth.



[source,yaml]
----
---
- hosts: ios
  gather_facts: no

  vars:

    log_servers:
      - logging 8.8.8.8
      - logging 8.8.4.4


  tasks:

  - name: get the current log server configs
    ios_command:
      commands:
        - show running-config full | include logging [0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+
    register: log

  - debug: var=log.stdout_lines


  - name: set logging commands
    ios_config:
      commands: "{{ item }}"
    loop: "{{ log_servers }}"
    register: set_logging


  - name: remove logging commands
    ios_config:
      commands: "no {{ item }}"
    when:  "item not in log_servers"
    loop: "{{ log.stdout_lines[0] }}"
    register: remove_logging


  - name: servicenow_network_tickets
    when: set_snmp.changed or remove_snmp.changed
    import_role:
      name: servicenow_network_tickets
----

This playbook was written in a way that it can be idempotent. On the first run the configs on the device do not match the state in the playbook.
There are two extra logging servers configured on the switches. You can see the playbook find them and remove those configs, which triggers a ticket to be created for each switch.

However, if you watch the second run no configs needed to be added or removed, so all those tasks were skipped and the ticket role was not imported.

[black big]*GitFlow*

While I developed this role on my own I still wanted to hold myself to using Git collaboration best practices. I used the GitFlow workflow for
all changes to the code. I created a [red]#devel# branch and worked in there for all my testing and additions to the codebase. Once I had something
new or a bug fix figured out and was happy with it, I created a Pull request against the [red]#master# branch. If you ever have a chance to contribute to
the open-source Ansible project on GitHub you will follow the same process of forking and creating pull requests.

Learning this flow is the most important things you can do to embrace and benefit from these developer tools our field is moving towards adopting.
When you are working on a code project with other people who are also contributing this flow becomes imperative.
Learn this before worrying about Travis CI, hooks, or anything else.



[black big]*One Role One Repo*

Utilizing the one role one repo thought process for scalability and compatibility with Galaxy.

I am a firm believer you should store your roles in their own repo, I like to call this style One Role One Repo. I am often asked how to structure your Git repos when getting started with network automation so that you can easily scale and not have to make a bunch of changes later down the road. Some folks look at my strange when I advise them to structure their repos like this. They say well what if I we grow to having 1000 roles, we don't want to have 1000 repo’s. Yes you do actually!

A great presentation on this subject was given by Sam Doran a Senior Software Dev at Ansible/Red Hat during AnsibleFest London 2017. I always recommend folks go and watch that if they want to understand how to scale. You can find that presentation recording https://www.ansible.com/running-ansible-at-scale[here]

Every role should be documented, permissioned and shared on it’s own. What if you want to share your BGP roles with a certain department but they don’t need to see your OSPF and MPLS roles. How would you easily share those if they were all in the same repo.

Ansible Galaxy uses this same system, every role can be downloaded or cloned separately. Hopefully you may have some roles that you wish to share with the community. Also when you start to maintain these roles with a CI/CD mindset and start using tools like https://www.zuul-ci.org[ZUUL]. It all makes sense why they should live in their own repo’s.



[black big]*Dependencies*

When you create a role using the [red]#ansible-galaxy init# command it will automatically create a meta/main.yml file. This file is
where you can list your role dependencies. In this case my role does require another role in order to function. If you
read https://www.thenetwork.engineer/blog/utilize-ansible-for-opening-and-closing-tickets-with-servicenow-part3[Part 3] I introduced you
to network-engine. There is no need to include a task to import the network-engine role as this is implied once you mention it in the meta/main.yml file.
Because I use Ansible Tower for everything I just add a requirements.yml file to the roles directory where my playbooks live and Tower automatically
runs the [red]#ansible-galaxy install -r roles/requirements.yml -p ./roles/ --force# command. You can find an example https://github.com/colin-mccarthy/ansible-playbooks-for-cisco-ios/blob/master/roles/requirements.yml[here].

[black big]*TravisCI*

I have been looking into adding some CI to this repo based on the repos of https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-firewall/blob/master/.travis.yml[GeerlingGuy] and https://github.com/nickrusso42518/racc/blob/master/.travis.yml[Nick Russo].

This is a tricky subject when dealing with Network Automation. What we are trying to accomplish can sometimes be harder to emulate and test. For instance trying to use CI/CD against a change to an Ansible playbook that modifies BGP neighbors can be a beast to reproduce in a test environment. It seems like the trend currently is to automate a linting test against the YAML and call it good. I decided to use https://twitter.com/travisci[TravisCI] because it is a cloud based SaaS model and does not require me to spin up and maintain a server. I have been looking into https://www.zuul-ci.org[ZUUL] as it uses Ansible playbooks to drive the CI however it would require I stand up a server. I didn't want to take on that kind of task right now but would like to try this out in the future hopefully.

I'm going to add CI to this the repo soon and create a follow up blog on this subject.


[black big]*Pre Commit Hooks*

https://pre-commit.com[pre-commit] is very valuable when you start to contribute to a repo with business rules and production code.
A great place to start is with linting your YAML and Ansible. Another great example is a hook that searches for secrets
just in case someone tries to commit them by accident. If you set up a pre-commit hook that kicks off when you try to got commit it will save you from sending
bad code to your repo It will save your CI from running and then blocking your commit. If you set up travis to use yamllint you could also set up a pre-Commit
hook that also uses yamllint and then you should never submit code that gets rejected by your TravisCI This is another one of those developer tools that I really
liked when I started looking into it.




https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-lint/[Ansible lint] is a command line checker tool.

https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html#installing-yamllint[yaml lint] is a yaml linter.

https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets[SecretsChecker] will scan for accidental passwords or secrets in the code your trying to commit.
